# EDL Loader repo

If you find any loaders not yet over here (or to replace a broken one here), feel free to commit them :D

# Why

People sell these, but they shouldn't be sold. Some loaders are no longer available. I've uploaded the loaders
for people to unbrick and repair their devices (which no longer have any warranty).

# Copyright holders / Vendors

If any of these loaders should be removed, please send an email to "info at revskills.de" (replace at with @) and I'll be happy to remove
them. If you want to add loaders to help people use your devices after warranty and for getting a great media reputation, feel free to send me the loaders to add them here. Much appreciated.

# Reference table of loaders

A [reference table](http://www.temblast.com/ref/loaders.htm) details Firehose loaders available on two sites.
You can search by PK hash or file MD5 to locate a loader.
